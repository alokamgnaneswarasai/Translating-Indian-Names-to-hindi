# Indian Name to Hindi Transliteration

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a character-level sequence-to-sequence model for transliterating Indian names from English to Hindi. The core components of the project include:

### Tokenizer
A custom tokenizer that handles the unique characteristics of Indian languages, including character-level encoding, decoding, and padding.

### Trainer
A generic trainer class capable of handling different model architectures, loss functions, and optimizers.

### Model Architectures
Different sequence-to-sequence models (RNN-based) for the transliteration task.
